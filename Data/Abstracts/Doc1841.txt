HTRON:Efficient Outdoor Navigation with Sparse Rewards via Heavy Tailed Adaptive Reinforce Algorithm
We present a novel approach to improve the performance of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based outdoor robot navigation systems. Most, existing DRL methods are based on carefully designed dense reward functions that learn the efficient behavior in an environment. We circumvent this issue by working only with sparse rewards (which are easy to design), and propose a novel adaptive Heavy-Tailed Reinforce algorithm for Outdoor Navigation called HTRON. Our main idea is to utilize heavy-tailed policy parametrizations which implicitly induce exploration in sparse reward settings. We evaluate the performance of HTRON against Reinforce, PPO and TRPO algorithms in three different outdoor scenarios: goal-reaching, obstacle avoidance, and uneven terrain navigation. We observe in average an increase of 34.41% in terms of success rate, a 15.15% decrease in the average time steps taken to reach the goal, and a 24.9% decrease in the elevation cost compared to the navigation policies obtained by the other methods. Further, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be transferred directly into a Clearpath Husky robot to perform outdoor terrain navigation in real-world scenarios.
