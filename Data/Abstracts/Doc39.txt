Fundamental Limits on Detection With a Dual-function Radar Communication System
This paper investigates the fundamental limits on the target detection performance with a dual-function multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar communication (RadCom) systems. By assuming the presence of a point-like target and a communication receiver, closed-form expressions for the maximum detection probability and the transmit waveforms achieving the optimal performance are derived. Results show that for the considered case, the dual-function system should transmit coherent waveforms to achieve the optimal detection performance. Moreover, the angle separation between the target and communication receiver has a great impact on the achievable detection performance.
