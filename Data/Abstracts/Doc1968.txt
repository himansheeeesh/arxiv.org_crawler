Ranking Tweets Considering Trust and Relevance
The increasing popularity of Twitter and other microblogs makes improved trustworthiness and relevance assessment of microblogs evermore important. We propose a method of ranking of tweets considering trustworthiness and content based popularity. The analysis of trustworthiness and popularity exploits the implicit relationships between the tweets. We model microblog ecosystem as a three-layer graph consisting of : (i) users (ii) tweets and (iii) web pages. We propose to derive trust and popularity scores of entities in these three layers, and propagate the scores to tweets considering the inter-layer relations. Our preliminary evaluations show improvement in precision and trustworthiness over the baseline methods and acceptable computation timings.
