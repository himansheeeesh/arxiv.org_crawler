Intelligent Reflecting Surface assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication System
High-speed communication and accurate sensing are of vital importance for future transportation system. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system has the advantages of high spectrum efficiency and low hardware cost, satisfying the requirements of sensing and communication. Therefore, ISAC is considered to be a promising technology in the future transportation system. However, due to the low transmit power of signal and the influence of harsh transmission environment on radar sensing, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the radar receiver is low, which affects the sensing performance. This paper introduces the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into ISAC system. With IRS composed of M sub-surfaces implemented on the surface of the target. The SNR at the radar receiver is 20lg(M) times larger than the scheme without IRS. Correspondingly, radar detection probability is significantly improved, and Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for ranging and velocity estimation is reduced. This paper proves the efficiency of IRS enabled ISAC system, which motivates the implementation of IRS to enhance the sensing capability in ISAC system.
