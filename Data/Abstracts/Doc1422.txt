Proof-of-randomness protocol for blockchain consensus: the white paper version 1.0
A proof-of-randomness (PoR) protocol could be a fair and low energy-cost consensus mechanism for blockchains. Each network node of a blockchain could use a true random number generator (TRNG) and hash algorism to fulfil the PoR protocol. In this whitepaper, we give the consensus mechanism of the PoR protocol, and show how it could make the random numbers unforgeable. The PoR protocol could generate a blockchain without any competition of computing power or stake of cryptocurrency. Besides, we give some advantages of integrating quantum random number generator (QRNG) chips in hardware wallets, and also discuss the route to cooperate with quantum key distribution (QKD) technology.
