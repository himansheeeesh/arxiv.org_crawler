BiViT: Extremely Compressed Binary Vision Transformer
Model binarization can significantly compress model size, reduce energy consumption, and accelerate inference through efficient bit-wise operations. Although binarizing convolutional neural networks have been extensively studied, there is little work on exploring binarization on vision Transformers which underpin most recent breakthroughs in visual recognition. To this end, we propose to solve two fundamental challenges to push the horizon of Binary Vision Transformers (BiViT). First, the traditional binary method does not take the long-tailed distribution of softmax attention into consideration, bringing large binarization errors in the attention module. To solve this, we propose Softmax-aware Binarization, which dynamically adapts to the data distribution and reduces the error caused by binarization. Second, to better exploit the information of the pretrained model and restore accuracy, we propose a Cross-layer Binarization scheme and introduce learnable channel-wise scaling factors for weight binarization. The former decouples the binarization of self-attention and MLP to avoid mutual interference while the latter enhances the representation capacity of binarized models. Overall, our method performs favorably against state-of-the-arts by 19.8% on the TinyImageNet dataset. On ImageNet, BiViT achieves a competitive 70.8% Top-1 accuracy over Swin-T model, outperforming the existing SOTA methods by a clear margin.
