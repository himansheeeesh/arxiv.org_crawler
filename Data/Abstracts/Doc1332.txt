The ISCSLP 2022 Intelligent Cockpit Speech Recognition Challenge (ICSRC): Dataset, Tracks, Baseline and Results
This paper summarizes the outcomes from the ISCSLP 2022 Intelligent Cockpit Speech Recognition Challenge (ICSRC). We first address the necessity of the challenge and then introduce the associated dataset collected from a new-energy vehicle (NEV) covering a variety of cockpit acoustic conditions and linguistic contents. We then describe the track arrangement and the baseline system. Specifically, we set up two tracks in terms of allowed model/system size to investigate resource-constrained and -unconstrained setups, targeting to vehicle embedded as well as cloud ASR systems respectively. Finally we summarize the challenge results and provide the major observations from the submitted systems.
