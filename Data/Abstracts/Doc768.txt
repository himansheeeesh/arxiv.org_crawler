Estimating Boltzmann Averages for Protein Structural Quantities Using Sequential Monte Carlo
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are widely used to draw samples from intractable target distributions. Particle degeneracy can hinder the use of SMC when the target distribution is highly constrained or multimodal. As a motivating application, we consider the problem of sampling protein structures from the Boltzmann distribution. This paper proposes a general SMC method that propagates multiple descendants for each particle, followed by resampling to maintain the desired number of particles. Simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the method for tackling the protein sampling problem. As a real data example, we use our method to estimate the number of atomic contacts for a key segment of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein.
