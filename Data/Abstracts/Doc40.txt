Matrix Syncer -- A Multi-chain Data Aggregator For Supporting Blockchain-based Metaverses
Due to the rising complexity of the metaverse's business logic and the low-latency nature of the metaverse, developers typically encounter the challenge of effectively reading, writing, and retrieving historical on-chain data in order to facilitate their functional implementations at scale. While it is true that accessing blockchain states is simple, more advanced real-world operations such as search, aggregation, and conditional filtering are not available when interacting directly with blockchain networks, particularly when dealing with requirements for on-chain event reflection. We offer Matrix Syncer, the ultimate middleware that bridges the data access gap between blockchains and end-user applications. Matrix Syncer is designed to facilitate the consolidation of on-chain information into a distributed data warehouse while also enabling customized on-chain state transformation for a scalable storage, access, and retrieval. It offers a unified layer for both on- and off-chain state, as well as a fast and flexible atomic query. Matrix Syncer is easily incorporated into any infrastructure to aggregate data from various blockchains concurrently, such as Ethereum and Flow. The system has been deployed to support several metaverse projects with a total value of more than $15 million USD.
