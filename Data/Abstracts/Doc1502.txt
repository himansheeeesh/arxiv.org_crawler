Sensitivity Analysis of Core Specialization Techniques
The instruction footprint of OS-intensive workloads such as web servers, database servers, and file servers typically exceeds the size of the instruction cache (32 KB). Consequently, such workloads incur a lot of i-cache misses, which reduces their performance drastically. Several papers have proposed to improve the performance of such workloads using core specialization. In this scheme, tasks with different instruction footprints are executed on different cores. In this report, we study the performance of five state of the art core specialization techniques: SelectiveOffload [6], FlexSC [8], DisAggregateOS [5], SLICC [2], and SchedTask [3] for different system parameters. Our studies show that for a suite of 8 popular OS-intensive workloads, SchedTask performs best for all evaluated configurations.
