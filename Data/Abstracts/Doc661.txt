A Trustworthy Framework for Medical Image Analysis with Deep Learning
Computer vision and machine learning are playing an increasingly important role in computer-assisted diagnosis; however, the application of deep learning to medical imaging has challenges in data availability and data imbalance, and it is especially important that models for medical imaging are built to be trustworthy. Therefore, we propose TRUDLMIA, a trustworthy deep learning framework for medical image analysis, which adopts a modular design, leverages self-supervised pre-training, and utilizes a novel surrogate loss function. Experimental evaluations indicate that models generated from the framework are both trustworthy and high-performing. It is anticipated that the framework will support researchers and clinicians in advancing the use of deep learning for dealing with public health crises including COVID-19.
