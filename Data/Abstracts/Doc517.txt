Facilitating Self-monitored Physical Rehabilitation with Virtual Reality and Haptic feedback
Physical rehabilitation is essential to recovery from joint replacement operations. As a representation, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) requires patients to conduct intensive physical exercises to regain the knee's range of motion and muscle strength. However, current joint replacement physical rehabilitation methods rely highly on therapists for supervision, and existing computer-assisted systems lack consideration for enabling self-monitoring, making at-home physical rehabilitation difficult. In this paper, we investigated design recommendations that would enable self-monitored rehabilitation through clinical observations and focus group interviews with doctors and therapists. With this knowledge, we further explored Virtual Reality(VR)-based visual presentation and supplemental haptic motion guidance features in our implementation VReHab, a self-monitored and multimodal physical rehabilitation system with VR and vibrotactile and pneumatic feedback in a TKA rehabilitation context. We found that the third point of view real-time reconstructed motion on a virtual avatar overlaid with the target pose effectively provides motion awareness and guidance while haptic feedback helps enhance users' motion accuracy and stability. Finally, we implemented \systemname to facilitate self-monitored post-operative exercises and validated its effectiveness through a clinical study with 10 patients.
