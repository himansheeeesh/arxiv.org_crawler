A Survey of Deep Graph Clustering: Taxonomy, Challenge, and Application
Graph clustering, which aims to divide the nodes in the graph into several distinct clusters, is a fundamental and challenging task. In recent years, deep graph clustering methods have been increasingly proposed and achieved promising performance. However, the corresponding survey paper is scarce and it is imminent to make a summary in this field. From this motivation, this paper makes the first comprehensive survey of deep graph clustering. Firstly, the detailed definition of deep graph clustering and the important baseline methods are introduced. Besides, the taxonomy of deep graph clustering methods is proposed based on four different criteria including graph type, network architecture, learning paradigm, and clustering method. In addition, through the careful analysis of the existing works, the challenges and opportunities from five perspectives are summarized. At last, the applications of deep graph clustering in four domains are presented. It is worth mentioning that a collection of state-of-the-art deep graph clustering methods including papers, codes, and datasets is available on GitHub. We hope this work will serve as a quick guide and help researchers to overcome challenges in this vibrant field.
