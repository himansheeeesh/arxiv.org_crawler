UniPreCIS : A data pre-processing solution for collocated services on shared IoT
Next-generation smart city applications, attributed by the power of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), significantly rely on the quality of sensing data. With an exponential increase in intelligent applications for urban development and enterprises offering sensing-as-aservice these days, it is imperative to provision for a shared sensing infrastructure for better utilization of resources. However, a shared sensing infrastructure that leverages low-cost sensing devices for a cost effective solution, still remains an unexplored territory. A significant research effort is still needed to make edge based data shaping solutions, more reliable, feature-rich and costeffective while addressing the associated challenges in sharing the sensing infrastructure among multiple collocated services with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Towards this, we propose a novel edge based data pre-processing solution, named UniPreCIS that accounts for the inherent characteristics of lowcost ambient sensors and the exhibited measurement dynamics with respect to application-specific QoS. UniPreCIS aims to identify and select quality data sources by performing sensor ranking and selection followed by multimodal data pre-processing in order to meet heterogeneous application QoS and at the same time reducing the resource consumption footprint for the resource constrained network edge. As observed, the processing time and memory utilization has been reduced in the proposed approach while achieving upto 90% accuracy which is arguably significant as compared to state-of-the-art techniques for sensing. The effectiveness of UniPreCIS has been evaluated on a testbed for a specific use case of indoor occupancy estimation that proves its effectiveness.
