Real-time CPU-based large-scale 3D mesh reconstruction
In Robotics, especially in this era of autonomous driving, mapping is one key ability of a robot to be able to navigate through an environment, localize on it and analyze its traversability. To allow for real-time execution on constrained hardware, the map usually estimated by feature-based or semi-dense SLAM algorithms is a sparse point cloud; a richer and more complete representation of the environment is desirable. Existing dense mapping algorithms require extensive use of GPU computing and they hardly scale to large environments; incremental algorithms from sparse points still represent an effective solution when light computational effort is needed and big sequences have to be processed in real-time. In this paper we improved and extended the state of the art incremental manifold mesh algorithm proposed in [1] and extended in [2]. While these algorithms do not achieve real-time and they embed points from SLAM or Structure from Motion only when their position is fixed, in this paper we propose the first incremental algorithm able to reconstruct a manifold mesh in real-time through single core CPU processing which is also able to modify the mesh according to 3D points updates from the underlying SLAM algorithm. We tested our algorithm against two state of the art incremental mesh mapping systems on the KITTI dataset, and we showed that, while accuracy is comparable, our approach is able to reach real-time performances thanks to an order of magnitude speed-up.
