FedTiny: Pruned Federated Learning Towards Specialized Tiny Models
Neural network pruning has been a well-established compression technique to enable deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. The pruned model is usually specialized to meet specific hardware platforms and training tasks (defined as deployment scenarios). However, existing pruning approaches rely heavily on training data to trade off model size, efficiency, and accuracy, which becomes ineffective for federated learning (FL) over distributed and confidential datasets. Moreover, the memory- and compute-intensive pruning process of most existing approaches cannot be handled by most FL devices with resource limitations. In this paper, we develop FedTiny, a novel distributed pruning framework for FL, to obtain specialized tiny models for memory- and computing-constrained participating devices with confidential local data. To alleviate biased pruning due to unseen heterogeneous data over devices, FedTiny introduces an adaptive batch normalization (BN) selection module to adaptively obtain an initially pruned model to fit deployment scenarios. Besides, to further improve the initial pruning, FedTiny develops a lightweight progressive pruning module for local finer pruning under tight memory and computational budgets, where the pruning policy for each layer is gradually determined rather than evaluating the overall deep model structure. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedTiny, which outperforms state-of-the-art baseline approaches, especially when compressing deep models to extremely sparse tiny models.
