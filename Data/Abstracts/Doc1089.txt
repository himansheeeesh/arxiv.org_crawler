BEV-Locator: An End-to-end Visual Semantic Localization Network Using Multi-View Images
Accurate localization ability is fundamental in autonomous driving. Traditional visual localization frameworks approach the semantic map-matching problem with geometric models, which rely on complex parameter tuning and thus hinder large-scale deployment. In this paper, we propose BEV-Locator: an end-to-end visual semantic localization neural network using multi-view camera images. Specifically, a visual BEV (Birds-Eye-View) encoder extracts and flattens the multi-view images into BEV space. While the semantic map features are structurally embedded as map queries sequence. Then a cross-model transformer associates the BEV features and semantic map queries. The localization information of ego-car is recursively queried out by cross-attention modules. Finally, the ego pose can be inferred by decoding the transformer outputs. We evaluate the proposed method in large-scale nuScenes and Qcraft datasets. The experimental results show that the BEV-locator is capable to estimate the vehicle poses under versatile scenarios, which effectively associates the cross-model information from multi-view images and global semantic maps. The experiments report satisfactory accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.052m, 0.135m and 0.251$^\circ$ in lateral, longitudinal translation and heading angle degree.
