ExpNet: A unified network for Expert-Level Classification
Different from the general visual classification, some classification tasks are more challenging as they need the professional categories of the images. In the paper, we call them expert-level classification. Previous fine-grained vision classification (FGVC) has made many efforts on some of its specific sub-tasks. However, they are difficult to expand to the general cases which rely on the comprehensive analysis of part-global correlation and the hierarchical features interaction. In this paper, we propose Expert Network (ExpNet) to address the unique challenges of expert-level classification through a unified network. In ExpNet, we hierarchically decouple the part and context features and individually process them using a novel attentive mechanism, called Gaze-Shift. In each stage, Gaze-Shift produces a focal-part feature for the subsequent abstraction and memorizes a context-related embedding. Then we fuse the final focal embedding with all memorized context-related embedding to make the prediction. Such an architecture realizes the dual-track processing of partial and global information and hierarchical feature interactions. We conduct the experiments over three representative expert-level classification tasks: FGVC, disease classification, and artwork attributes classification. In these experiments, superior performance of our ExpNet is observed comparing to the state-of-the-arts in a wide range of fields, indicating the effectiveness and generalization of our ExpNet. The code will be made publicly available.
