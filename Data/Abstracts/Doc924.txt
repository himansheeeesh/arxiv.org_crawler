Shoupa: An AI System for Early Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive nervous system disorder that has affected more than 5.8 million people, especially the elderly. Due to the complexity of its symptoms and its similarity to other neurological disorders, early detection requires neurologists or PD specialists to be involved, which is not accessible to most old people. Therefore, we integrate smart mobile devices with AI technologies. In this paper, we introduce the framework of our developed PD early detection system which combines different tasks evaluating both motor and non-motor symptoms. With the developed model, we help users detect PD punctually in non-clinical settings and figure out their most severe symptoms. The results are expected to be further used for PD rehabilitation guidance and detection of other neurological disorders.
