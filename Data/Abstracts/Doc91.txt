Hybrid Models for Learning to Branch
In this work, we address the challenge of market congestion via the multi-agent assortment optimization problem in the two-sided sequential matching model introduced by Ashlagi et al. (2020b). The setting is the following: we (the platform) offer a menu of suppliers to each customer. Then, every customer selects, simultaneously and independently, to match with a supplier or to remain unmatched. Each supplier observes the subset of customers that selected them, and chooses either to match a customer or to leave the system. Therefore, a match takes place if both a customer and a supplier sequentially select each other. Each agent's behavior is probabilistic and determined by a discrete choice model. Our goal is to choose an assortment family that maximizes the expected revenue of the matching. Given the complexity of the problem, we show several constant factor approximation guarantees for an heterogeneous setting where customers follow different multinomial logit models and suppliers follow a general choice model whose demand function is monotone and submodular. Furthermore, we obtain the first constant approximation guarantees when the problem is subject to cardinality constraints and the objective is the revenue of the matching. Our approach relies on submodular optimization techniques and appropriate randomized rounding methods. We also provide several extensions of our results, notably, the problem becomes polynomially solvable when we allow suppliers to select an unlimited number of customers as long as the corresponding subproblems are polynomially solvable. We also discuss managerial implications of this model. In particular, we show that for matching platforms it is better to allow the agents whose opposite side is less attractive to initiate the matchmaking process. Finally, we provide an extensive computational study that supports our technical and managerial results.
