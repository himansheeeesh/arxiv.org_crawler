Scan2Plan: Efficient Floorplan Generation from 3D Scans of Indoor Scenes
We introduce Scan2Plan, a novel approach for accurate estimation of a floorplan from a 3D scan of the structural elements of indoor environments. The proposed method incorporates a two-stage approach where the initial stage clusters an unordered point cloud representation of the scene into room instances and wall instances using a deep neural network based voting approach. The subsequent stage estimates a closed perimeter, parameterized by a simple polygon, for each individual room by finding the shortest path along the predicted room and wall keypoints. The final floorplan is simply an assembly of all such room perimeters in the global co-ordinate system. The Scan2Plan pipeline produces accurate floorplans for complex layouts, is highly parallelizable and extremely efficient compared to existing methods. The voting module is trained only on synthetic data and evaluated on publicly available Structured3D and BKE datasets to demonstrate excellent qualitative and quantitative results outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.
