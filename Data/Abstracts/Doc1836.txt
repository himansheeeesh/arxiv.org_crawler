Multi-fidelity wavelet neural operator with application to uncertainty quantification
Operator learning frameworks, because of their ability to learn nonlinear maps between two infinite dimensional functional spaces and utilization of neural networks in doing so, have recently emerged as one of the more pertinent areas in the field of applied machine learning. Although these frameworks are extremely capable when it comes to modeling complex phenomena, they require an extensive amount of data for successful training which is often not available or is too expensive. However, this issue can be alleviated with the use of multi-fidelity learning, where a model is trained by making use of a large amount of inexpensive low-fidelity data along with a small amount of expensive high-fidelity data. To this end, we develop a new framework based on the wavelet neural operator which is capable of learning from a multi-fidelity dataset. The developed model's excellent learning capabilities are demonstrated by solving different problems which require effective correlation learning between the two fidelities for surrogate construction. Furthermore, we also assess the application of the developed framework for uncertainty quantification. The results obtained from this work illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed framework.
