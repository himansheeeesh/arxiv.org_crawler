Vision Transformer for Adaptive Image Transmission over MIMO Channels
This paper presents a vision transformer (ViT) based joint source and channel coding (JSCC) scheme for wireless image transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, called ViT-MIMO. The proposed ViT-MIMO architecture, in addition to outperforming separation-based benchmarks, can flexibly adapt to different channel conditions without requiring retraining. Specifically, exploiting the self-attention mechanism of the ViT enables the proposed ViT-MIMO model to adaptively learn the feature mapping and power allocation based on the source image and channel conditions. Numerical experiments show that ViT-MIMO can significantly improve the transmission quality cross a large variety of scenarios, including varying channel conditions, making it an attractive solution for emerging semantic communication systems.
