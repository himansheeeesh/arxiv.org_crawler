Universal Adversarial Audio Perturbations
We demonstrate the existence of universal adversarial perturbations, which can fool a family of audio classification architectures, for both targeted and untargeted attack scenarios. We propose two methods for finding such perturbations. The first method is based on an iterative, greedy approach that is well-known in computer vision: it aggregates small perturbations to the input so as to push it to the decision boundary. The second method, which is the main contribution of this work, is a novel penalty formulation, which finds targeted and untargeted universal adversarial perturbations. Differently from the greedy approach, the penalty method minimizes an appropriate objective function on a batch of samples. Therefore, it produces more successful attacks when the number of training samples is limited. Moreover, we provide a proof that the proposed penalty method theoretically converges to a solution that corresponds to universal adversarial perturbations. We also demonstrate that it is possible to provide successful attacks using the penalty method when only one sample from the target dataset is available for the attacker. Experimental results on attacking various 1D CNN architectures have shown attack success rates higher than 85.0% and 83.1% for targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively using the proposed penalty method.
