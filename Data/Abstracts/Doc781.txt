COVID-19 denialism in Brazil: a multifactor study
We discuss the relationships between the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil at the municipal level and different health, social, demographic, and economic indices. We obtain significant correlations between the data gathered for each municipalitiy and the proportion of cases and deaths by COVID-19 and the results by municipality of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election. We obtain different estimates for the number of deaths caused by central government denialism of scientific facts and measures for mitigation of the pandemic and its the historical, economic, and social roots.
