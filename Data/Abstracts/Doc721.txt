Multiple Structural Breaks in Interactive Effects Panel Data and the Impact of Quantitative Easing on Bank Lending
Economists are concerned about the many recent disruptive events such as the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, and their likely effect on economic relationships. The fear is that the relationships might have changed, which has implications for both estimation and policymaking. Motivated by this last observation, the present paper develops a new toolbox for multiple structural break detection in panel data models with interactive effects. The toolbox includes several tests for the presence of structural breaks, a break date estimator, and a break date confidence interval. The new toolbox is applied to a large panel data set covering 3,557 US banks between 2005 and 2021, a period characterized by a number of massive quantitative easing programs to lessen the impact of the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The question we ask is: Have these programs been successful in spurring bank lending in the US economy? The short answer turns out to be: ``No''.
