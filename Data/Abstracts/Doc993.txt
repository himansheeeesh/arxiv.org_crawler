Automated discovery of generalized standard material models with EUCLID
We extend the scope of our approach for unsupervised automated discovery of material laws (EUCLID) to the case of a material belonging to an unknown class of behavior. To this end, we leverage the theory of generalized standard materials, which encompasses a plethora of important constitutive classes. We show that, based only on full-field kinematic measurements and net reaction forces, EUCLID is able to automatically discover the two scalar thermodynamic potentials, namely, the Helmholtz free energy and the dissipation potential, which completely define the behavior of generalized standard materials. The a priori enforced constraint of convexity on these potentials guarantees by construction stability and thermodynamic consistency of the discovered model; balance of linear momentum acts as a fundamental constraint to replace the availability of stress-strain labeled pairs; sparsity promoting regularization enables the automatic selection of a small subset from a possibly large number of candidate model features and thus leads to a parsimonious, i.e., simple and interpretable, model. Importantly, since model features go hand in hand with the correspondingly active internal variables, sparse regression automatically induces a parsimonious selection of the few internal variables needed for an accurate but simple description of the material behavior. A fully automatic procedure leads to the selection of the hyperparameter controlling the weight of the sparsity promoting regularization term, in order to strike a user-defined balance between model accuracy and simplicity. By testing the method on synthetic data including artificial noise, we demonstrate that EUCLID is able to automatically discover the true hidden material model from a large catalog of constitutive classes, including elasticity, viscoelasticity, elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity, isotropic and kinematic hardening.
