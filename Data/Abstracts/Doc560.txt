Video Instance Shadow Detection
Video instance shadow detection aims to simultaneously detect, segment, associate, and track paired shadow-object associations in videos. This work has three key contributions to the task. First, we design SSIS-Track, a new framework to extract shadow-object associations in videos with paired tracking and without category specification; especially, we strive to maintain paired tracking even the objects/shadows are temporarily occluded for several frames. Second, we leverage both labeled images and unlabeled videos, and explore temporal coherence by augmenting the tracking ability via an association cycle consistency loss to optimize SSIS-Track's performance. Last, we build $\textit{SOBA-VID}$, a new dataset with 232 unlabeled videos of ${5,863}$ frames for training and 60 labeled videos of ${1,182}$ frames for testing. Experimental results show that SSIS-Track surpasses baselines built from SOTA video tracking and instance-shadow-detection methods by a large margin. In the end, we showcase several video-level applications.
