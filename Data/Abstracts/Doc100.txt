Activation Adaptation in Neural Networks
Many neural network architectures rely on the choice of the activation function for each hidden layer. Given the activation function, the neural network is trained over the bias and the weight parameters. The bias catches the center of the activation, and the weights capture the scale. Here we propose to train the network over a shape parameter as well. This view allows each neuron to tune its own activation function and adapt the neuron curvature towards a better prediction. This modification only adds one further equation to the back-propagation for each neuron. Re-formalizing activation functions as CDF generalizes the class of activation function extensively. We aimed at generalizing an extensive class of activation functions to study: i) skewness and ii) smoothness of activation functions. Here we introduce adaptive Gumbel activation function as a bridge between Gumbel and sigmoid. A similar approach is used to invent a smooth version of ReLU. Our comparison with common activation functions suggests different data representation especially in early neural network layers. This adaptation also provides prediction improvement.
