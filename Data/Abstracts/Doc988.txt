Balanced Deep CCA for Bird Vocalization Detection
Event detection improves when events are captured by two different modalities rather than just one. But to train detection systems on multiple modalities is challenging, in particular when there is abundance of unlabelled data but limited amounts of labeled data. We develop a novel self-supervised learning technique for multi-modal data that learns (hidden) correlations between simultaneously recorded microphone (sound) signals and accelerometer (body vibration) signals. The key objective of this work is to learn useful embeddings associated with high performance in downstream event detection tasks when labeled data is scarce and the audio events of interest (songbird vocalizations) are sparse. We base our approach on deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) that suffers from event sparseness. We overcome the sparseness of positive labels by first learning a data sampling model from the labelled data and by applying DCCA on the output it produces. This method that we term balanced DCCA (b-DCCA) improves the performance of the unsupervised embeddings on the downstream supervised audio detection task compared to classsical DCCA. Because data labels are frequently imbalanced, our method might be of broad utility in low-resource scenarios.
