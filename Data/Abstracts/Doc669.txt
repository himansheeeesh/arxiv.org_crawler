High Performance Computing and Computational Intelligence Applications with MultiChaos Perspective
The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated many chaotic processes in modern society, has highlighted in a very serious and urgent way the need to understand complex processes in order to achieve the common well-being. Modern High performance computing technologies, Quantum Computing, Computational Intelligence are shown to be extremely efficient and useful in safeguarding the fate of mankind. These technologies are the state of the art of IT evolution and are fundamental to be competitive and efficient today. If a company is familiar with these techniques and technologies, will be able to deal with any unexpected and complicated scenario more efficiently and effectively. The main contribution of our work is a set of best practices and case studies that can help the researcher address computationally complex problems. We offer a range of software technologies, from high performance computing to machine learning and quantum computing, which represent today the state of the art to deal with extremely complex computational issues, driven by chaotic events and not easily predictable. In this chapter we analyse the different technologies and applications that will lead mankind to overcome this difficult moment, as well as to understand more and more deeply the profound aspects of very complex phenomena. In this environment of rising complexity, both in terms of technology, algorithms, and changing lifestyles, it is critical to emphasize the importance of achieving maximum efficiency and outcomes while protecting the integrity of everyone's personal data and respecting the human being as a whole.
