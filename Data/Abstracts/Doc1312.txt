Approximate Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons
A common problem in machine learning is to rank a set of n items based on pairwise comparisons. Here ranking refers to partitioning the items into sets of pre-specified sizes according to their scores, which includes identification of the top-k items as the most prominent special case. The score of a given item is defined as the probability that it beats a randomly chosen other item. Finding an exact ranking typically requires a prohibitively large number of comparisons, but in practice, approximate rankings are often adequate. Accordingly, we study the problem of finding approximate rankings from pairwise comparisons. We analyze an active ranking algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and decides whether to stop or which pair of items to compare next, based on confidence intervals computed from the data collected in previous steps. We show that this algorithm succeeds in recovering approximate rankings using a number of comparisons that is close to optimal up to logarithmic factors. We also present numerical results, showing that in practice, approximation can drastically reduce the number of comparisons required to estimate a ranking.
