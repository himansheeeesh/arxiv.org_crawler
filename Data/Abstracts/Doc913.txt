Learning Motion-Robust Remote Photoplethysmography through Arbitrary Resolution Videos
The image recapture attack is an effective image manipulation method to erase certain forensic traces, and when targeting on personal document images, it poses a great threat to the security of e-commerce and other web applications. Considering the current learning-based methods suffer from serious overfitting problem, in this paper, we propose a novel two-branch deep neural network by mining better generalized recapture artifacts with a designed frequency filter bank and multi-scale cross-attention fusion module. In the extensive experiment, we show that our method can achieve better generalization capability compared with state-of-the-art techniques on different scenarios.
