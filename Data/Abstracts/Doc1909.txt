The Value Chain of Education Metaverse
Since the end of 2021, the Metaverse has been booming. Many unknown possibilities are gradually being realized, but many people only determined that they use Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) in the Metaverse. It is even considered that as long as the above realities (VR, AR, MR) are used, it is equal to the Metaverse. However, this is not true, for Reality-based display tools are only one of the presentation methods of the Metaverse. If we cannot return to the three main characteristics of the Metaverse: "digital avatars," a decentralized "consensus value system," and "Immersive experience," the practice and imagination of the Metaverse will become very narrow. Since 2022, the concept of Metaverse has also been widely used in classroom teaching to integrate into teaching activities. Therefore, to prevent teachers and students from understanding the Metaverse not only in the "Using VR, AR, MR is equivalent to Metaverse" but also pay more attention to the other two characteristics of the Metaverse: "digital avatars" and a decentralized "consensus value system."
