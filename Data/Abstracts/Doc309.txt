Diff-Font: Diffusion Model for Robust One-Shot Font Generation
Font generation is a difficult and time-consuming task, especially in those languages using ideograms that have complicated structures with a large number of characters, such as Chinese. To solve this problem, few-shot font generation and even one-shot font generation have attracted a lot of attention. However, most existing font generation methods may still suffer from (i) large cross-font gap challenge; (ii) subtle cross-font variation problem; and (iii) incorrect generation of complicated characters. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot font generation method based on a diffusion model, named Diff-Font, which can be stably trained on large datasets. The proposed model aims to generate the entire font library by giving only one sample as the reference. Specifically, a large stroke-wise dataset is constructed, and a stroke-wise diffusion model is proposed to preserve the structure and the completion of each generated character. To our best knowledge, the proposed Diff-Font is the first work that developed diffusion models to handle the font generation task. The well-trained Diff-Font is not only robust to font gap and font variation, but also achieved promising performance on difficult character generation. Compared to previous font generation methods, our model reaches state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.
