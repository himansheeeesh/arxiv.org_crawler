Video based Contextual Question Answering
The primary aim of this project is to build a contextual Question-Answering model for videos. The current methodologies provide a robust model for image based Question-Answering, but we are aim to generalize this approach to be videos. We propose a graphical representation of video which is able to handle several types of queries across the whole video. For example, if a frame has an image of a man and a cat sitting, it should be able to handle queries like, where is the cat sitting with respect to the man? or ,what is the man holding in his hand?. It should be able to answer queries relating to temporal relationships also.
