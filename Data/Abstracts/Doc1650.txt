Objects as Spatio-Temporal 2.5D points
Determining accurate bird's eye view (BEV) positions of objects and tracks in a scene is vital for various perception tasks including object interactions mapping, scenario extraction etc., however, the level of supervision required to accomplish that is extremely challenging to procure. We propose a light-weight, weakly supervised method to estimate 3D position of objects by jointly learning to regress the 2D object detections and scene's depth prediction in a single feed-forward pass of a network. Our proposed method extends a center-point based single-shot object detector, and introduces a novel object representation where each object is modeled as a BEV point spatio-temporally, without the need of any 3D or BEV annotations for training and LiDAR data at query time. The approach leverages readily available 2D object supervision along with LiDAR point clouds (used only during training) to jointly train a single network, that learns to predict 2D object detection alongside the whole scene's depth, to spatio-temporally model object tracks as points in BEV. The proposed method is computationally over $\sim$10x efficient compared to recent SOTA approaches while achieving comparable accuracies on KITTI tracking benchmark.
