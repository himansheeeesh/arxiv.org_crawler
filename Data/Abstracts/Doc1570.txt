Edge-Aware Image Compression using Deep Learning-based Super-resolution Network
We propose a learning-based compression scheme that envelopes a standard codec between pre and post-processing deep CNNs. Specifically, we demonstrate improvements over prior approaches utilizing a compression-decompression network by introducing: (a) an edge-aware loss function to prevent blurring that is commonly occurred in prior works & (b) a super-resolution convolutional neural network (CNN) for post-processing along with a corresponding pre-processing network for improved rate-distortion performance in the low rate regime. The algorithm is assessed on a variety of datasets varying from low to high resolution namely Set 5, Set 7, Classic 5, Set 14, Live 1, Kodak, General 100, CLIC 2019. When compared to JPEG, JPEG2000, BPG, and recent CNN approach, the proposed algorithm contributes significant improvement in PSNR with an approximate gain of 20.75%, 8.47%, 3.22%, 3.23% and 24.59%, 14.46%, 10.14%, 8.57% at low and high bit-rates respectively. Similarly, this improvement in MS-SSIM is approximately 71.43%, 50%, 36.36%, 23.08%, 64.70% and 64.47%, 61.29%, 47.06%, 51.52%, 16.28% at low and high bit-rates respectively. With CLIC 2019 dataset, PSNR is found to be superior with approximately 16.67%, 10.53%, 6.78%, and 24.62%, 17.39%, 14.08% at low and high bit-rates respectively, over JPEG2000, BPG, and recent CNN approach. Similarly, the MS-SSIM is found to be superior with approximately 72%, 45.45%, 39.13%, 18.52%, and 71.43%, 50%, 41.18%, 17.07% at low and high bit-rates respectively, compared to the same approaches. A similar type of improvement is achieved with other datasets also.
