PlutoAR: An Inexpensive, Interactive And Portable Augmented Reality Based Interpreter For K-10 Curriculum
The regular K-10 curriculums often do not get the necessary of affordable technology involving interactive ways of teaching the prescribed curriculum with effective analytical skill building. In this paper, we present "PlutoAR", a paper-based augmented reality interpreter which is scalable, affordable, portable and can be used as a platform for skill building for the kids. PlutoAR manages to overcome the conventional albeit non-interactive ways of teaching by incorporating augmented reality (AR) through an interactive toolkit to provide students with the best of both worlds. Students cut out paper "tiles" and place these tiles one by one on a larger paper surface called "Launchpad" and use the PlutoAR mobile application which runs on any Android device with a camera and uses augmented reality to output each step of the program like an interpreter. PlutoAR has inbuilt AR experiences like stories, maze solving using conditional loops, simple elementary mathematics and the intuition of gravity.
