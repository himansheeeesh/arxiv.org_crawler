Faster Algorithm for Structured John Ellipsoid Computation
Computing John Ellipsoid is a fundamental problem in machine learning and convex optimization, where the goal is to compute the ellipsoid with maximal volume that lies in a given convex centrally symmetric polytope defined by a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. In this work, we show two faster algorithms for approximating the John Ellipsoid.$\bullet$ For sparse matrix $A$, we can achieve nearly input sparsity time $\mathrm{nnz}(A) + d^ω$, where $ω$ is exponent of matrix multiplication. Currently, $ω\approx 2.373$.$\bullet$ For the matrix $A$ which has small treewidth $τ$, we can achieve $n τ^2$ time.Therefore, we significantly improves the state-of-the-art results on approximating the John Ellipsoid for centrally symmetric polytope [Cohen, Cousins, Lee, and Yang COLT 2019] which takes $nd^2$ time.
