Influence Analysis in the Blogosphere
In this paper we analyze influence in the blogosphere. Recently, influence analysis has become an increasingly important research topic, as online communities, such as social networks and e-commerce sites, playing a more and more significant role in our daily life. However, so far few studies have succeeded in extracting influence from online communities in a satisfactory way. One of the challenges that limited previous researches is that it is difficult to capture user behaviors. Consequently, the influence among users could only be inferred in an indirect and heuristic way, which is inaccurate and noise-prone. In this study, we conduct an extensive investigation in regard to influence among bloggers at a Japanese blog web site, BIGLOBE. By processing the log files of the web servers, we are able to accurately extract the activities of BIGLOBE members in terms of writing their blog posts and reading other member's posts. Based on these activities, we propose a principled framework to detect influence among the members with high confidence level. From the extracted influence, we conduct in-depth analysis on how influence varies over different topics and how influence varies over different members. We also show the potentials of leveraging the extracted influence to make personalized recommendation in BIGLOBE. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first studies that capture and analyze influence in the blogosphere in such a large scale.
