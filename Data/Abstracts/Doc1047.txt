A cost-benefit analysis of low latency via added utilization
Several recently proposed techniques achieve latency reduction by trading it off for some amount of additional bandwidth usage. But how would one quantify whether the tradeoff is actually beneficial in a given system? We develop an economic cost vs. benefit analysis for answering this question. We use the analysis to derive a benchmark for wide-area client-server applications, and demonstrate how it can be applied to reason about a particular latency saving technique --- redundant DNS requests.
