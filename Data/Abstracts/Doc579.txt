Distributed Black-box Attack against Image Classification Cloud Services
Black-box adversarial attacks can fool image classifiers into misclassifying images without requiring access to model structure and weights. Recently proposed black-box attacks can achieve a success rate of more than 95% after less than 1,000 queries. The question then arises of whether black-box attacks have become a real threat against IoT devices that rely on cloud APIs to achieve image classification. To shed some light on this, note that prior research has primarily focused on increasing the success rate and reducing the number of required queries. However, another crucial factor for black-box attacks against cloud APIs is the time required to perform the attack. This paper applies black-box attacks directly to cloud APIs rather than to local models, thereby avoiding multiple mistakes made in prior research. Further, we exploit load balancing to enable distributed black-box attacks that can reduce the attack time by a factor of about five for both local search and gradient estimation methods.
