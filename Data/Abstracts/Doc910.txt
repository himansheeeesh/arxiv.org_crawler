One-shot recognition of any material anywhere using contrastive learning with physics-based rendering
We present MatSim: a synthetic dataset, a benchmark, and a method for computer vision based recognition of similarities and transitions between materials and textures, focusing on identifying any material under any conditions using one or a few examples (one-shot learning). The visual recognition of materials is essential to everything from examining food while cooking to inspecting agriculture, chemistry, and industrial products. In this work, we utilize giant repositories used by computer graphics artists to generate a new CGI dataset for material similarity. We use physics-based rendering (PBR) repositories for visual material simulation, assign these materials random 3D objects, and render images with a vast range of backgrounds and illumination conditions (HDRI). We add a gradual transition between materials to support applications with a smooth transition between states (like gradually cooked food). We also render materials inside transparent containers to support beverage and chemistry lab use cases. We then train a contrastive learning network to generate a descriptor that identifies unfamiliar materials using a single image. We also present a new benchmark for a few-shot material recognition that contains a wide range of real-world examples, including the state of a chemical reaction, rotten/fresh fruits, states of food, different types of construction materials, types of ground, and many other use cases involving material states, transitions and subclasses. We show that a network trained on the MatSim synthetic dataset outperforms state-of-the-art models like Clip on the benchmark, despite being tested on material classes that were not seen during training. The dataset, benchmark, code and trained models are available online.
