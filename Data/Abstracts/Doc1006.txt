Connectivity-Aware Pheromone Mobility Model for Autonomous UAV Networks
UAV networks consisting of reduced size, weight, and power (low SWaP) fixed-wing UAVs are used for civilian and military applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, and tracking. To carry out these operations efficiently, there is a need to develop scalable, decentralized autonomous UAV network architectures with high network connectivity. However, the area coverage and the network connectivity requirements exhibit a fundamental trade-off. In this paper, a connectivity-aware pheromone mobility (CAP) model is designed for search and rescue operations, which is capable of maintaining connectivity among UAVs in the network. We use stigmergy-based digital pheromone maps along with distance-based local connectivity information to autonomously coordinate the UAV movements, in order to improve its map coverage efficiency while maintaining high network connectivity.
