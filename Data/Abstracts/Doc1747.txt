Indian Political Twitter and Caste Discrimination -- How Representation Does Not Equal Inclusion in Lok Sabha Networks
Caste privilege persists in the form of upper caste "networks" in India made up of political, social, and economic relations that tend to actively exclude lower caste members. In this study, we examine this pernicious expression of caste in the Twitter networks of politicians from India's highest legislative body - the Lok Sabha. We find that caste has a significant relationship with the centrality, connectivity and engagement of an MP in the Lok Sabha Twitter network. The higher the caste of a Member of the Parliament (MP) the more likely they are to be important in the network, to have reciprocal connections with other MPs, and to get retweeted by an upper caste MPs.
