Space-time design for deep joint source channel coding of images Over MIMO channels
We propose novel deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) algorithms for wireless image transmission over multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Rayleigh fading channels, when channel state information (CSI) is available only at the receiver. We consider two different transmission schemes; one exploiting spatial diversity and the other one exploiting spatial multiplexing of the MIMO channel. In the diversity scheme, we utilize an orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) to achieve full diversity which increases the robustness of transmission against channel variations. The multiplexing scheme, on the other hand, allows the user to directly map the codeword to the antennas, where the additional degree-of-freedom is used to send more information about the source signal. Simulation results show that the diversity scheme outperforms the multiplexing scheme at lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values and smaller number of receive antennas at the AP. When the number of transmit antennas is greater than two, however, the full-diversity scheme becomes less beneficial. We also show that both the diversity and multiplexing scheme can achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art BPG algorithm delivered at the MIMO capacity in the considered scenarios.
