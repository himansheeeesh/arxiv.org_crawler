Hitting Times of Random Walks on Edge Corona Product Graphs
Graph products have been extensively applied to model complex networks with striking properties observed in real-world complex systems. In this paper, we study the hitting times for random walks on a class of graphs generated iteratively by edge corona product. We first derive recursive solutions to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the normalized adjacency matrix associated with the graphs. Based on these results, we further obtain interesting quantities about hitting times of random walks, providing iterative formulas for two-node hitting time, as well as closed-form expressions for the Kemeny's constant defined as a weighted average of hitting times over all node pairs, as well as the arithmetic mean of hitting times of all pairs of nodes.
