Modelling plausible scenarios for the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant from early-stage surveillance
In this paper we used an adapted version of an existing simulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Scotland to investigate the rise of the Omicron variant of concern, in order to evaluate plausible scenarios for transmission advantage and vaccine immune escape relative to the Delta variant. We also explored possible outcomes of different levels of imposed non-pharmaceutical intervention. The initial results of these scenarios were used to inform the Scottish Government in the early outbreak stages of the Omicron variant.We use an explicitly spatial agent-based simulation model combined with spatially fine-grained COVID-19 observation data from Public Health Scotland. Using the model with parameters fit over the Delta variant epidemic, some initial assumptions about Omicron transmission advantage and vaccine escape, and a simple growth rate fitting procedure, we were able to capture the initial outbreak dynamics for Omicron. We also find the modelled dynamics hold up to retrospective scrutiny.We found that the modelled imposition of extra non-pharmaceutical interventions planned by the Scottish Government at the time would likely have little effect in light of the transmission advantage held by the Omicron variant and the fact that the planned interventions would have occurred too late in the outbreak's trajectory. Finally, we found that any assumptions made about the projected distribution of vaccines in the model population had little bearing on the outcome, in terms of outbreak size and timing, rather that the detailed landscape of immunity prior to the outbreak was of far greater importance.
