Discourse-Aware Graph Networks for Textual Logical Reasoning
Textual logical reasoning, especially question answering (QA) tasks with logical reasoning, requires awareness of particular logical structures. The passage-level logical relations represent entailment or contradiction between propositional units (e.g., a concluding sentence). However, such structures are unexplored as current QA systems focus on entity-based relations. In this work, we propose logic structural-constraint modeling to solve the logical reasoning QA and introduce discourse-aware graph networks (DAGNs). The networks perform two procedures: (1) logic graph construction that leverages in-line discourse connectives as well as generic logic theories, (2) logic representation learning by graph networks that produces structural logic features. This pipeline is applied to a general encoder, whose fundamental features are joined with the high-level logic features for answer prediction. Experiments on three textual logical reasoning datasets demonstrate the reasonability of the logical structures built in DAGNs and the effectiveness of the learned logic features. Moreover, zero-shot transfer results show the features' generality to unseen logical texts.
