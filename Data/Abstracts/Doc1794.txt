A Novel Approach for Effective Learning in Low Resourced Scenarios
Deep learning based discriminative methods, being the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, are ill-suited for learning from lower amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called simultaneous two sample learning (s2sL), to effectively learn the class discriminative characteristics, even from very low amount of data. In s2sL, more than one sample (here, two samples) are simultaneously considered to both, train and test the classifier. We demonstrate our approach for speech/music discrimination and emotion classification through experiments. Further, we also show the effectiveness of s2sL approach for classification in low-resource scenario, and for imbalanced data.
