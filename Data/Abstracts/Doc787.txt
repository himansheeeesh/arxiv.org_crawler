Emerging dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants
Accurate and reliable forecasting of emerging dominant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants enables policymakers and vaccine makers to get prepared for future waves of infections. The last three waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by dominant variants Omicron (BA.1), BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5 were accurately foretold by our artificial intelligence (AI) models built with biophysics, genotyping of viral genomes, experimental data, algebraic topology, and deep learning. Based on newly available experimental data, we analyzed the impacts of all possible viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our analysis sheds light on viral evolutionary mechanisms, i.e., natural selection through infectivity strengthening and antibody resistance. We forecast that BA.2.10.4, BA.2.75, BQ.1.1, and particularly, BA.2.75+R346T, have high potential to become new dominant variants to drive the next surge.
