FedDig: Robust Federated Learning Using Data Digest to Represent Absent Clients
Federated Learning (FL) effectively protects client data privacy. However, client absence or leaving during training can seriously degrade model performances, particularly for unbalanced and non-IID client data. We address this issue by generating data digests from the raw data and using them to guide training at the FL moderator. The proposed FL framework, called FedDig, can tolerate unexpected client absence in cross-silo scenarios while preserving client data privacy because the digests de-identify the raw data by mixing encoded features in the features space. We evaluate FedDig using EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100; the results consistently outperform against three baseline algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, and FedNova) by large margins in various client absence scenarios.
