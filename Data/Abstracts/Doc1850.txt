Summarize and Generate to Back-translate: Unsupervised Translation of Programming Languages
Back-translation is widely known for its effectiveness for neural machine translation when little to no parallel data is available. In this approach, a source-to-target model is coupled with a target-to-source model trained in parallel. The target-to-source model generates noisy sources, while the source-to-target model is trained to reconstruct the targets and vice versa. Recent developments of multilingual pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models for programming languages have been very effective for a broad spectrum of downstream software engineering tasks. Hence, it is compelling to train them to build programming language translation systems via back-translation. However, these models cannot be further trained via back-translation since they learn to output sequences in the same language as the inputs during pre-training. As an alternative, we propose performing back-translation via code summarization and generation. In code summarization, a model learns to generate natural language (NL) summaries given code snippets. In code generation, the model learns to do the opposite. Therefore, target-to-source generation in back-translation can be viewed as target-to-NL-to-source generation. We show that our proposed approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods.
