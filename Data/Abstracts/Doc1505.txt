Three Experiments to Analyze the Nature of the Heat Spreader
In this paper, we describe ongoing work to investigate the properties of the heat spreader, and its implication on architecture research. In specific, we conduct two experiments to quantify the heat distribution across the surface of a spreader during normal operation. The first experiment uses T-type thermocouples, to find the temperature difference across different points on the spreader. We observe about a 6 degree celsius temperature difference on average. In the second experiment, we try to capture the temperature gradients using an infrared camera. However, this experiment was inconclusive because of some practical constraints such as the low emissivity of the spreader. We conclude that to properly model the spreader, it is necessary to conduct detailed finite element simulations. We describe a method to accurately measure the thermal conductivity of the heat spreader such that it can be used to compute the steady state temperature distribution across the spreader.
