ZK-IMG: Attested Images via Zero-Knowledge Proofs to Fight Disinformation
Over the past few years, AI methods of generating images have been increasing in capabilities, with recent breakthroughs enabling high-resolution, photorealistic "deepfakes" (artificially generated images with the purpose of misinformation or harm). The rise of deepfakes has potential for social disruption. Recent work has proposed using ZK-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) and attested cameras to verify that images were taken by a camera. ZK-SNARKs allow verification of image transformations non-interactively (i.e., post-hoc) with only standard cryptographic hardness assumptions. Unfortunately, this work does not preserve input privacy, is impractically slow (working only on 128$\times$128 images), and/or requires custom cryptographic arguments.To address these issues, we present zk-img, a library for attesting to image transformations while hiding the pre-transformed image. zk-img allows application developers to specify high level image transformations. Then, zk-img will transparently compile these specifications to ZK-SNARKs. To hide the input or output images, zk-img will compute the hash of the images inside the ZK-SNARK. We further propose methods of chaining image transformations securely and privately, which allows for arbitrarily many transformations. By combining these optimizations, zk-img is the first system to be able to transform HD images on commodity hardware, securely and privately.
