Order from chaos in quantum walks on cyclic graphs
It has been shown classically that combining two chaotic random walks can yield an ordered(periodic) walk. Our aim in this paper is to find a quantum analog for this rather counter-intuitive result. We study chaotic and periodic nature of cyclic quantum walks and focus on a unique situation wherein a periodic quantum walk on a 3-cycle graph is generated via a deterministic combination of two chaotic quantum walks on the same graph. We extend our results to even-numbered cyclic graphs, specifically a 4-cycle graph too. Our results will be relevant in quantum cryptography and quantum chaos control.
