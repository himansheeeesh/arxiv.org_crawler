CMT: Interpretable Model for Rapid Recognition Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images by Fusing Low Complexity Multilevel Attention Mechanism
Chest imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing and predicting patients with COVID-19 with evidence of worsening respiratory status. Many deep learning-based diagnostic models for pneumonia have been developed to enable computer-aided diagnosis. However, the long training and inference time make them inflexible. In addition, the lack of interpretability reduces their credibility in clinical medical practice. This paper presents CMT, a model with interpretability and rapid recognition of pneumonia, especially COVID-19 positive. Multiple convolutional layers in CMT are first used to extract features in CXR images, and then Transformer is applied to calculate the possibility of each symptom. To improve the model's generalization performance and to address the problem of sparse medical image data, we propose Feature Fusion Augmentation (FFA), a plug-and-play method for image augmentation. It fuses the features of the two images to varying degrees to produce a new image that does not deviate from the original distribution. Furthermore, to reduce the computational complexity and accelerate the convergence, we propose Multilevel Multi-Head Self-Attention (MMSA), which computes attention on different levels to establish the relationship between global and local features. It significantly improves the model performance while substantially reducing its training and inference time. Experimental results on the largest COVID-19 dataset show the proposed CMT has state-of-the-art performance. The effectiveness of FFA and MMSA is demonstrated in the ablation experiments. In addition, the weights and feature activation maps of the model inference process are visualized to show the CMT's interpretability.
