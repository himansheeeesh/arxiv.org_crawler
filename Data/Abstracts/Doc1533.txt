Selective manipulation of disentangled representations for privacy-aware facial image processing
Camera sensors are increasingly being combined with machine learning to perform various tasks such as intelligent surveillance. Due to its computational complexity, most of these machine learning algorithms are offloaded to the cloud for processing. However, users are increasingly concerned about privacy issues such as function creep and malicious usage by third-party cloud providers. To alleviate this, we propose an edge-based filtering stage that removes privacy-sensitive attributes before the sensor data are transmitted to the cloud. We use state-of-the-art image manipulation techniques that leverage disentangled representations to achieve privacy filtering. We define opt-in and opt-out filter operations and evaluate their effectiveness for filtering private attributes from face images. Additionally, we examine the effect of naturally occurring correlations and residual information on filtering. We find the results promising and believe this elicits further research on how image manipulation can be used for privacy preservation.
