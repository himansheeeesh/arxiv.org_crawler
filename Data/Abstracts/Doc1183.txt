CL-CrossVQA: A Continual Learning Benchmark for Cross-Domain Visual Question Answering
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a multi-discipline research task. To produce the right answer, it requires an understanding of the visual content of images, the natural language questions, as well as commonsense reasoning over the information contained in the image and world knowledge. Recently, large-scale Vision-and-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) have been the mainstream approach to VQA tasks due to their superior performance. The standard practice is to fine-tune large-scale VLPMs pre-trained on huge general-domain datasets using the domain-specific VQA datasets. However, in reality, the application domain can change over time, necessitating VLPMs to continually learn and adapt to new domains without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Most existing continual learning (CL) research concentrates on unimodal tasks, whereas a more practical application scenario, i.e, CL on cross-domain VQA, has not been studied. Motivated by this, we introduce CL-CrossVQA, a rigorous Continual Learning benchmark for Cross-domain Visual Question Answering, through which we conduct extensive experiments on 4 VLPMs, 4 CL approaches, and 5 VQA datasets from different domains. In addition, by probing the forgetting phenomenon of the intermediate layers, we provide insights into how model architecture affects CL performance, why CL approaches can help mitigate forgetting in VLPMs to some extent, and how to design CL approaches suitable for VLPMs in this challenging continual learning environment. To facilitate future work on CL for cross-domain VQA, we will release our datasets and code.
