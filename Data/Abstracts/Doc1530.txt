Semantics-based Privacy by Design for Internet of Things Applications
As Internet of Things (IoT) technologies become more widespread in everyday life, privacy issues are becoming more prominent. The aim of this research is to develop a personal assistant that can answer software engineers' questions about Privacy by Design (PbD) practices during the design phase of IoT system development. Semantic web technologies are used to model the knowledge underlying PbD measurements, their intersections with privacy patterns, IoT system requirements and the privacy patterns that should be applied across IoT systems. This is achieved through the development of the PARROT ontology, developed through a set of representative IoT use cases relevant for software developers. This was supported by gathering Competency Questions (CQs) through a series of workshops, resulting in 81 curated CQs. These CQs were then recorded as SPARQL queries, and the developed ontology was evaluated using the Common Pitfalls model with the help of the Protégé HermiT Reasoner and the Ontology Pitfall Scanner (OOPS!), as well as evaluation by external experts. The ontology was assessed within a user study that identified that the PARROT ontology can answer up to 58\% of privacy-related questions from software engineers.
