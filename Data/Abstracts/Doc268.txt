Fairness in Face Presentation Attack Detection
Face presentation attack detection (PAD) is critical to secure face recognition (FR) applications from presentation attacks. FR performance has been shown to be unfair to certain demographic and non-demographic groups. However, the fairness of face PAD is an understudied issue, mainly due to the lack of appropriately annotated data. To address this issue, this work first presents a Combined Attribute Annotated PAD Dataset (CAAD-PAD) by combining several well-known PAD datasets where we provide seven human-annotated attribute labels. This work then comprehensively analyses the fairness of a set of face PADs and its relation to the nature of training data and the Operational Decision Threshold Assignment (ODTA) on different data groups by studying four face PAD approaches on our CAAD-PAD. To simultaneously represent both the PAD fairness and the absolute PAD performance, we introduce a novel metric, namely the Accuracy Balanced Fairness (ABF). Extensive experiments on CAAD-PAD show that the training data and ODTA induce unfairness on gender, occlusion, and other attribute groups. Based on these analyses, we propose a data augmentation method, FairSWAP, which aims to disrupt the identity/semantic information and guide models to mine attack cues rather than attribute-related information. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that FairSWAP generally enhances both the PAD performance and the fairness of face PAD.
