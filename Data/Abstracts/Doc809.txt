Isolation mechanisms for high-speed packet-processing pipelines
The purpose of this paper is to study nonlinear singular parabolic equations with $p(x)$- Laplacian. Precisely, we consider the following problem and discuss the existence of a non-negative weak solution.\begin{align*}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-Δ_{p(x)}u&=λu^{q(x)-1} + u^{-δ(x)}g+ f&&\text{in}~Q_T,u&= 0&&\text{on}~Σ_T,u(0,\cdot)&=u_0(\cdot)&&\text{in}~Ω\nonumber.\end{align*}Here $Q_T=Ω\times(0,T)$, $Σ_T=\partialΩ\times(0,T)$, $Ω$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$) with Lipschitz continuous boundary $\partialΩ$, $λ\in(0,\infty)$, $f\in L^1(Q_T)$, $g\in L^\infty(Ω)$, $u_0\in L^r(Ω)$ with $r\geq 2$, $δ:\overlineΩ\rightarrow(0,\infty)$ is continuous, and $p,q\in C(\overlineΩ)$ with $\underset{x\in\overlineΩ}{\max}~p(x)<N$, $q(\cdot)<p^*(\cdot)$.The article is distinguished into two cases according to the choice of $f$ with different range of parameters $p(\cdot)$, $q(\cdot)$.
