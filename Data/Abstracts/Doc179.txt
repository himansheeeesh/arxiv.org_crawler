Tight Exponential Strong Converse for Source Coding Problem with Encoded Side Information
The source coding problem with encoded side information is considered. A lower bound on the strong converse exponent has been derived by Oohama, but its tightness has not been clarified. In this paper, we derive a tight strong converse exponent. The achievability part is derived by a careful analysis of the type argument. The converse part is proved by a judicious use of the change-of-measure argument, which was introduced by Gu-Effros and further developed by Tyagi-Watanabe. Interestingly, the soft Markov constraint, which was introduced by Oohama as a proof technique, is naturally incorporated into the characterization of the exponent.
