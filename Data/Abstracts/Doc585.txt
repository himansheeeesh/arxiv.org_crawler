Feng-Shui Compass: A Modern Exploration of Traditional Chinese Environmental Analysis
The technological advancement in data analysis and sensor technology has contributed to a growth in knowledge of the surrounding environments. Feng Shui, the Chinese philosophy of evaluating a certain environment and how it influences human well-being, can only be determined by self-claimed specialists for the past thousands of years. We developed a device as well as a procedure to evaluate the ambient environment of a room to perform a study that attempts to use sensor data to predict the well-being score of a person in that environment, therefore evaluating the primary aspect of Feng Shui. Our study revealed preliminary results showing great potential for further research with larger experiments.
