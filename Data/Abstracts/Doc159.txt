Streaming Joint Speech Recognition and Disfluency Detection
Disfluency detection has mainly been solved in a pipeline approach, as post-processing of speech recognition. In this study, we propose Transformer-based encoder-decoder models that jointly solve speech recognition and disfluency detection, which work in a streaming manner. Compared to pipeline approaches, the joint models can leverage acoustic information that makes disfluency detection robust to recognition errors and provide non-verbal clues. Moreover, joint modeling results in low-latency and lightweight inference. We investigate two joint model variants for streaming disfluency detection: a transcript-enriched model and a multi-task model. The transcript-enriched model is trained on text with special tags indicating the starting and ending points of the disfluent part. However, it has problems with latency and standard language model adaptation, which arise from the additional disfluency tags. We propose a multi-task model to solve such problems, which has two output layers at the Transformer decoder; one for speech recognition and the other for disfluency detection. It is modeled to be conditioned on the currently recognized token with an additional token-dependency mechanism. We show that the proposed joint models outperformed a BERT-based pipeline approach in both accuracy and latency, on both the Switchboard and the corpus of spontaneous Japanese.
