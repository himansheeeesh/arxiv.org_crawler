Self-encoding Barnacle Mating Optimizer Algorithm for Manpower Scheduling in Flow Shop
Flow Shop Scheduling (FSS) has been widely researched due to its application in many types of fields, while the human participant brings great challenges to this problem. Manpower scheduling captures attention for assigning workers with diverse proficiency to the appropriate stages, which is of great significance to production efficiency.In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called Self-encoding Barnacle Mating Optimizer (SBMO), which solves the FSS problem considering worker proficiency, defined as a new problem, Flow Shop Manpower Scheduling Problem (FSMSP). The highlight of the SBMO algorithm is the combination with the encoding method, crossover and mutation operators. Moreover, in order to solve the local optimum problem, we design a neighborhood search scheme. Finally, the extensive comparison simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SBMO. The results indicate the effectiveness of SBMO in approximate ratio, powerful stability, and execution time, compared with the classic and popular counterparts.
