Accelerating Dataset Distillation via Model Augmentation
Dataset Distillation (DD), a newly emerging field, aims at generating much smaller and high-quality synthetic datasets from large ones. Existing DD methods based on gradient matching achieve leading performance; however, they are extremely computationally intensive as they require continuously optimizing a dataset among thousands of randomly initialized models. In this paper, we assume that training the synthetic data with diverse models leads to better generalization performance. Thus we propose two \textbf{model augmentation} techniques, ~\ie using \textbf{early-stage models} and \textbf{weight perturbation} to learn an informative synthetic set with significantly reduced training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves up to 20$\times$ speedup and comparable performance on par with state-of-the-art baseline methods.
