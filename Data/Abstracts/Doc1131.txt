Learning Appearance-motion Normality for Video Anomaly Detection
Video anomaly detection is a challenging task in the computer vision community. Most single task-based methods do not consider the independence of unique spatial and temporal patterns, while two-stream structures lack the exploration of the correlations. In this paper, we propose spatial-temporal memories augmented two-stream auto-encoder framework, which learns the appearance normality and motion normality independently and explores the correlations via adversarial learning. Specifically, we first design two proxy tasks to train the two-stream structure to extract appearance and motion features in isolation. Then, the prototypical features are recorded in the corresponding spatial and temporal memory pools. Finally, the encoding-decoding network performs adversarial learning with the discriminator to explore the correlations between spatial and temporal patterns. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving AUCs of 98.1% and 89.8% on UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue datasets.
