EyeNet: A Multi-Task Network for Off-Axis Eye Gaze Estimation and User Understanding
Eye gaze estimation and simultaneous semantic understanding of a user through eye images is a crucial component in Virtual and Mixed Reality; enabling energy efficient rendering, multi-focal displays and effective interaction with 3D content. In head-mounted VR/MR devices the eyes are imaged off-axis to avoid blocking the user's gaze, this view-point makes drawing eye related inferences very challenging. In this work, we present EyeNet, the first single deep neural network which solves multiple heterogeneous tasks related to eye gaze estimation and semantic user understanding for an off-axis camera setting. The tasks include eye segmentation, blink detection, emotive expression classification, IR LED glints detection, pupil and cornea center estimation. To train EyeNet end-to-end we employ both hand labelled supervision and model based supervision. We benchmark all tasks on MagicEyes, a large and new dataset of 587 subjects with varying morphology, gender, skin-color, make-up and imaging conditions.
