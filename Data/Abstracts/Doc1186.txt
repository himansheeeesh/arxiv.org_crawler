Gated Recurrent Neural Networks with Weighted Time-Delay Feedback
We introduce a novel gated recurrent unit (GRU) with a weighted time-delay feedback mechanism in order to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies in sequential data. This model is a discretized version of a continuous-time formulation of a recurrent unit, where the dynamics are governed by delay differential equations (DDEs). By considering a suitable time-discretization scheme, we propose $τ$-GRU, a discrete-time gated recurrent unit with delay. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the continuous-time model, and we demonstrate that the proposed feedback mechanism can help improve the modeling of long-term dependencies. Our empirical results show that $τ$-GRU can converge faster and generalize better than state-of-the-art recurrent units and gated recurrent architectures on a range of tasks, including time-series classification, human activity recognition, and speech recognition.
