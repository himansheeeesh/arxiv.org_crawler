Learning Rotation Adaptive Correlation Filters in Robust Visual Object Tracking
Visual object tracking is one of the major challenges in the field of computer vision. Correlation Filter (CF) trackers are one of the most widely used categories in tracking. Though numerous tracking algorithms based on CFs are available today, most of them fail to efficiently detect the object in an unconstrained environment with dynamically changing object appearance. In order to tackle such challenges, the existing strategies often rely on a particular set of algorithms. Here, we propose a robust framework that offers the provision to incorporate illumination and rotation invariance in the standard Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) formulation. We also supervise the detection stage of DCF trackers by eliminating false positives in the convolution response map. Further, we demonstrate the impact of displacement consistency on CF trackers. The generality and efficiency of the proposed framework is illustrated by integrating our contributions into two state-of-the-art CF trackers: SRDCF and ECO. As per the comprehensive experiments on the VOT2016 dataset, our top trackers show substantial improvement of 14.7% and 6.41% in robustness, 11.4% and 1.71% in Average Expected Overlap (AEO) over the baseline SRDCF and ECO, respectively.
