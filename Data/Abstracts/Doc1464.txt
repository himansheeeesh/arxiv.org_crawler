Leveraging Pre-Trained Language Models to Streamline Natural Language Interaction for Self-Tracking
Current natural language interaction for self-tracking tools largely depends on bespoke implementation optimized for a specific tracking theme and data format, which is neither generalizable nor scalable to a tremendous design space of self-tracking. However, training machine learning models in the context of self-tracking is challenging due to the wide variety of tracking topics and data formats. In this paper, we propose a novel NLP task for self-tracking that extracts close- and open-ended information from a retrospective activity log described as a plain text, and a domain-agnostic, GPT-3-based NLU framework that performs this task. The framework augments the prompt using synthetic samples to transform the task into 10-shot learning, to address a cold-start problem in bootstrapping a new tracking topic. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline QA models. Going further, we discuss future application domains toward which the NLP and HCI researchers can collaborate.
