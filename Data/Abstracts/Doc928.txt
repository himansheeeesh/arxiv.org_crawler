EEGLog: Lifelogging EEG Data When You Listen to Music
Self-tracking has been long discussed, which can monitor daily activities and help users to recall previous experiences. Such data-capturing technique is no longer limited to photos, text messages, or personal diaries in recent years. With the development of wearable EEG devices, we introduce a novel modality of logging EEG data while listening to music, and bring up the idea of the neural-centric way of life with the designed data analysis application named EEGLog. Four consumer-grade wearable EEG devices are explored by collecting EEG data from 24 participants. Three modules are introduced in EEGLog, including the summary module of EEG data, emotion reports, music listening activities, and memorial moments, the emotion detection module, and the music recommendation module. Feedback from interviews about using EEG devices and EEGLog were obtained and analyzed for future EEG logging development.
