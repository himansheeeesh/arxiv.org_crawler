On the use of Stress information in Speech for Speaker Recognition
The performance of a speaker recognition system decreases when the speaker is under stress or emotion. In this paper we explore and identify a mechanism that enables use of inherent stress-in-speech or speaking style information present in speech of a person as additional cues for speaker recognition. We quantify the the inherent stress present in the speech of a speaker mainly using 3 features, namely, pitch, amplitude and duration (together called PAD) We experimentally observe that the PAD vectors of similar phones in different words of a speaker are close to each other in the three dimensional (PAD) space confirming that the way a speaker stresses different syllables in their speech is unique to them, thus we propose the use of PAD based speaking style of a speaker as an additional feature for speaker recognition applications.
