On the Robustness, Generalization, and Forgetting of Shape-Texture Debiased Continual Learning
Tremendous progress has been made in continual learning to maintain good performance on old tasks when learning new tasks by tackling the catastrophic forgetting problem of neural networks. This paper advances continual learning by further considering its out-of-distribution robustness, in response to the vulnerability of continually trained models to distribution shifts (e.g., due to data corruptions and domain shifts) in inference. To this end, we propose shape-texture debiased continual learning. The key idea is to learn generalizable and robust representations for each task with shape-texture debiased training. In order to transform standard continual learning to shape-texture debiased continual learning, we propose shape-texture debiased data generation and online shape-texture debiased self-distillation. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach in improving generalization and robustness, as well as reducing forgetting. Our analysis on the flatness of the loss landscape explains the advantages. Moreover, our approach can be easily combined with new advanced architectures such as vision transformer, and applied to more challenging scenarios such as exemplar-free continual learning.
