Digital divide is one of the challenges that open government must face in mid- and low-income countries. In these contexts, inhabitants are left out of the benefits of information and communication technology (ICT), such as online government services. The present scenario that has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic offers opportunities and challenges in ICT access and use to current and potential users all over the world. Therefore, it is important to know the advancement in digital inclusion in the recent years, particularly regarding the consumption and use of ICT goods and services.
