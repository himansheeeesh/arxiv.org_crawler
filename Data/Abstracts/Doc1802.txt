Mobile Phone Based Vehicle License Plate Recognition for Road Policing
Identity of a vehicle is done through the vehicle license plate by traffic police in general. Au- tomatic vehicle license plate recognition has several applications in intelligent traffic management systems. The security situation across the globe and particularly in India demands a need to equip the traffic police with a system that enables them to get instant details of a vehicle. The system should be easy to use, should be mobile, and work 24 x 7. In this paper, we describe a mobile phone based, client-server architected, license plate recognition system. While we use the state of the art image processing and pattern recognition algorithms tuned for Indian conditions to automatically recognize non-uniform license plates, the main contribution is in creating an end to end usable solution. The client application runs on a mobile device and a server application, with access to vehicle information database, is hosted centrally. The solution enables capture of license plate image captured by the phone camera and passes to the server; on the server the license plate number is recognized; the data associated with the number plate is then sent back to the mobile device, instantaneously. We describe the end to end system architecture in detail. A working prototype of the proposed system has been implemented in the lab environment.
