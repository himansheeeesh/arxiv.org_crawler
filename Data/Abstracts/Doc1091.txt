Automated Driving Systems Data Acquisition and Processing Platform
This paper presents an automated driving system (ADS) data acquisition and processing platform for vehicle trajectory extraction, reconstruction, and evaluation based on connected automated vehicle (CAV) cooperative perception. This platform presents a holistic pipeline from the raw advanced sensory data collection to data processing, which can process the sensor data from multiple CAVs and extract the objects' Identity (ID) number, position, speed, and orientation information in the map and Frenet coordinates. First, the ADS data acquisition and analytics platform are presented. Specifically, the experimental CAVs platform and sensor configuration are shown, and the processing software, including a deep-learning-based object detection algorithm using LiDAR information, a late fusion scheme to leverage cooperative perception to fuse the detected objects from multiple CAVs, and a multi-object tracking method is introduced. To further enhance the object detection and tracking results, high definition maps consisting of point cloud and vector maps are generated and forwarded to a world model to filter out the objects off the road and extract the objects' coordinates in Frenet coordinates and the lane information. In addition, a post-processing method is proposed to refine trajectories from the object tracking algorithms. Aiming to tackle the ID switch issue of the object tracking algorithm, a fuzzy-logic-based approach is proposed to detect the discontinuous trajectories of the same object. Finally, results, including object detection and tracking and a late fusion scheme, are presented, and the post-processing algorithm's improvements in noise level and outlier removal are discussed, confirming the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed holistic data collection and processing platform.
