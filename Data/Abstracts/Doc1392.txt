EM-X-DL: Efficient Cross-Device Deep Learning Side-Channel Attack with Noisy EM Signatures
This work presents a Cross-device Deep-Learning based Electromagnetic (EM-X-DL) side-channel analysis (SCA), achieving >90% single-trace attack accuracy on AES-128, even in the presence of significantly lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compared to the previous works. With an intelligent selection of multiple training devices and proper choice of hyperparameters, the proposed 256-class deep neural network (DNN) can be trained efficiently utilizing pre-processing techniques like PCA, LDA, and FFT on the target encryption engine running on an 8-bit Atmel microcontroller. Finally, an efficient end-to-end SCA leakage detection and attack framework using EM-X-DL demonstrates high confidence of an attacker with <20 averaged EM traces.
