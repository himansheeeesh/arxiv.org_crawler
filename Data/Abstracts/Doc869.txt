What comes next? Extractive summarization by next-sentence prediction
Existing approaches to automatic summarization assume that a length limit for the summary is given, and view content selection as an optimization problem to maximize informativeness and minimize redundancy within this budget. This framework ignores the fact that human-written summaries have rich internal structure which can be exploited to train a summarization system. We present NEXTSUM, a novel approach to summarization based on a model that predicts the next sentence to include in the summary using not only the source article, but also the summary produced so far. We show that such a model successfully captures summary-specific discourse moves, and leads to better content selection performance, in addition to automatically predicting how long the target summary should be. We perform experiments on the New York Times Annotated Corpus of summaries, where NEXTSUM outperforms lead and content-model summarization baselines by significant margins. We also show that the lengths of summaries produced by our system correlates with the lengths of the human-written gold standards.
