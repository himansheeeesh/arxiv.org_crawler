Game theoretical analysis of Kidney Exchange Programs
The goal of a kidney exchange program (KEP) is to maximize number of transplants within a pool of incompatible patient-donor pairs by exchanging donors. A KEP can be modelled as a maximum matching problem in a graph. A KEP between incompatible patient-donor from pools of several hospitals, regions or countries has the potential to increase the number of transplants. These entities aim is to maximize the transplant benefit for their patients, which can lead to strategic behaviours. Recently, this was formulated as a non-cooperative two-player game and the game solutions (equilibria) were characterized when the entities objective function is the number of their patients receiving a kidney. In this paper, we generalize these results for $N$-players and discuss the impact in the game solutions when transplant information quality is introduced. Furthermore, the game theory model is analyzed through computational experiments on instances generated through the Canada Kidney Paired Donation Program. These experiments highlighting the importance of using the concept of Nash equilibrium, as well as, the anticipation of the necessity to further research for supporting police makers once measures on transplant quality are available.
