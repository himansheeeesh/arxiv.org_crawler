Recent Advances in Natural Language Inference: A Survey of Benchmarks, Resources, and Approaches
In the NLP community, recent years have seen a surge of research activities that address machines' ability to perform deep language understanding which goes beyond what is explicitly stated in text, rather relying on reasoning and knowledge of the world. Many benchmark tasks and datasets have been created to support the development and evaluation of such natural language inference ability. As these benchmarks become instrumental and a driving force for the NLP research community, this paper aims to provide an overview of recent benchmarks, relevant knowledge resources, and state-of-the-art learning and inference approaches in order to support a better understanding of this growing field.
