LAD: Language Augmented Diffusion for Reinforcement Learning
Learning skills from language provides a powerful avenue for generalization in reinforcement learning, although it remains a challenging task as it requires agents to capture the complex interdependencies between language, actions, and states. In this paper, we propose leveraging Language Augmented Diffusion models as a planner conditioned on language (LAD). We demonstrate the comparable performance of LAD with the state-of-the-art on the CALVIN language robotics benchmark with a much simpler architecture that contains no inductive biases specialized to robotics, achieving an average success rate (SR) of 72% compared to the best performance of 76%. We also conduct an analysis on the properties of language conditioned diffusion in reinforcement learning.
